# Display-IP-Address

// Unfortunately, directly converting latitude and longitude to a location name (city, state, etc.) is not possible using pure JavaScript without any external APIs. This process, called reverse geocoding, requires accessing geographical databases and translating coordinates into human-readable addresses. JavaScript alone doesn't have this built-in functionality.
